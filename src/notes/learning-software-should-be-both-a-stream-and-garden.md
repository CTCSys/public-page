# Learning software should be both a stream and garden
<Stage stage="seedling" />
I have noticed that we seem to think of [[Time horizons of the web]] as mutually exclusive. Twitter, for example, is just a stream, while your knowledge base (or note taking app) is a garden where you curate content. For [SRS to operate at the OS-level](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z36iMKLe4CDAXdtLSJD4Z6qPPFUS8ZXymUk3i)  then we must end this distinction. This system would need to know about your calendar in order to best schedule learning sessions, ect. It would want to hook into your information streams like Youtube or RSS to best schedule times to actively learn about new information and help make connections to your existing garden. 
This is the same as ifâ€¦
