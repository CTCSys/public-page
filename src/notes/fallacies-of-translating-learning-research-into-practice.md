title: Fallacies of translating learning research into practice
stage: seedling
---
There is a lot of learning research that has been published, but just because its published doesnâ€™t mean it we should be applying it to the classroom, learning tools, or our personal learning.   In [Ask the Cognitive Scientist: Should Teachers Know the Basic Science of How Children Learn?](https://www.aft.org/ae/summer2019/willingham) , Daniel Willingham outlines a model for translating learning research into practice and also explores [[Who should be taught about learning research?]] 
First off, we need to understand that  [[Learning research deepens our understanding of cognition and helps us question our intuition about learning]]  But this does not mean that learning research that is scientifically sound should be put into practice. Following [[The scientific method]]  we can categorize 3 types scientific statements:
1. Empirical generalization
2. Theoretical statements 
3. Epistemic assumptions

> Empirical generalizations usually apply to /one aspect/ of a complex situation, but educators must consider all aspects of the situation.
