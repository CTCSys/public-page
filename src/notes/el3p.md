The Engineering Lifelong Learning Program (EL3P) started as a research study to investigate the impact that weekly discussions about learning science can have on students. I was lucky enough to participate in the program for my entire undergraduate education and even facilitate the program for two years. By diving deep into learning research, reflecting, and making commitments to apply learning techniques to our own education I was able to experience firsthand and secondhand how impactful this program has been to students.
