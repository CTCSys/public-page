In [Reality has a surprising amount of detail](http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail) John Salvatier leads us through a how building a /simple/ stair case can be surprisingly hard when you don’t gloss over the process. He extrapolates that this granularity of detail exists in all domains, it’s just easy to overlook if we haven’t taken the time and energy to examine.
