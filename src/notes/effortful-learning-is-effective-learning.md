# Effortful learning is effective learning

The *tenet* of learning is that you must actively exert energy in order to physically change neural connections in your brain. It seems that every research-based learning technique follows this principle. [[Active Retrieval Practice]] is more effective than [[Passive Retrieval Practice]], for the very reason that it takes more effort to recall than reread. [[Spaced Practice]] is more effective than cramming because it means that you must recall from long-term memory rather than short-term memory. For similar reasons, [[Interleaving]] and [[Varied Practice]] are more effective than continually practicing the same type of skill over and over.
The paradox to this is unfortunately that [[Increasing effort to learn can conceal the benefits of doing so]]  My hope is that *tools for thought* can solve this problem by highlighting feedback and progress that is not immediately visible!
