# Students need to have greater accessibility to research-based learning techniques
<Stage stage="seedling" />
 An interesting observation from my experiences in [[EL3P]] is that every guest that we would invite to discuss learning science with (i.e. Barbra Oakley, Ben Carey, and Peter Brown,  ect.) would mention how talking with our group was one of the rare occurrences where they had discussions with students and that our discussions were far more impactful than the ones they had speaking to educators. How is it that these folks, who are quite well-versed in learning research, rarely get the chance to have *discussions* with students?  
Barbra Oakleyâ€™s MOOC [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)  is a great attempt to increase the accessibility to students, but I still have a feeling that teacher-student discussions are going to be more impactful.
