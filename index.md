Welcome to my little part of the internet! I'm Chris Shank and this website is a collection of ideas, notes, and writings that I have been thinking through. Think of it like walking through a small garden that I'm cultivating. Some of the thoughts might be incomplete (and possibly incoherent) while others may have blossomed ðŸŒº.

Currently I am exploring the intersection between learning an technology, trying to _push_ how far technology can augment the learning process. The goal is find ways for us to learn quicker, yet more effective, while more accessible to those with less privilege. ðŸ“š This project is called the _Learning Toolbox_.

## Here are some noteworthy places to dive in to!
