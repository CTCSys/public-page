## The Way of Correct Posting Content and Discussion

Today the major mass of Internet posts, actions or discussions seem not to be real, honest and not sourced by responsible human beings. 

Try fixing that a bit here - run a real owned profile, an own domain and post from here. It is not that much of work, time and money to set one up.

Use your content and post & link it into (social media) silos like Linkedin et al but control all of it from your owned sources.
