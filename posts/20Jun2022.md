### Screening & Aggregation from the Best and Provenly Working Structures, Use and Refine -> Create New Better

#### Level up self service - let users - the SME do what the need and help create

Having worked deeply on OTC Liquidity Aggregation solutions (FX/PMs low latency executable price streaming / RFQing) and also still on professional coding (incl tody bank- & before bio-/informatics big data processing) - eg. software libraries, packages or just sturctures screening, code/functions/modules aggregation but also even to general knowledge aggregation like from scientific papers, journals or books when you study - where finally all comes down to find and go through mostly unstructured information. 

Modern big data screening and learning from sources - and they are not static, rather dynamic and going into streaming like levels - having constantly more ppl producing them by better hard & software processing & piping all of it, this is the great challenge for anybody try to make best use of what is already there.

To really help finding and engaging anyone try to start and needs helping hands, help on finding tools and education up to real ppl helping out across the globe, there is no good (central) way to go afaik, but lots of separate bits and peaces exists scattered all over and try to trap your search want to be THE single liquidity / tooling / Code-package / solution  provider, risking of let you alone by interfacing, assemble and make it finally work - even if that simple thing that could be easy like recored by some MS Excel Macro and you never need to care about the VBA at first place.
