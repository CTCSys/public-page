## Need For More Private Web Content & Pages

 Learning how & why to build this ... it is easier & cheaper as it seems.

 Why share ideas and content and not really own it? It is made too easy today by 'Silicon Valley' to get ppl creating all the content by giving 'free' access and tools to publish for all, but not let participate or even fully control what gets mass-delivered for free.

 The new(!) process must better be:
 - First make sure your content is fully owend & controlled by you - like this blog here I'm writing on my own sites
 
 - Later might share it to LinkedIn, ..., the only 'free' network I am using today

 - Next all your content / blogs should be commented as you want to - first here (see e.g. Disqus, Commento,...) and after sharing why not mirror external comments into your owned sites? - Get ppl directly commenting here? 
 
 Main problem: Incentives, bootstrapping + easy to do (yes ppl are lazy)

 ### It must be easy to do, cheap but properly incentified  
 
 What is today fast and easy enough to get started? - Maybe there are better ways, but here is one (to discuss):

 First: It is quite cheap and easy to get and own your domain

 Second: It is still free to get a GitHub account
 
 Third: Fork my or others demo-sites repositories by save your changes locally & publish from there to your Git repo
 
 Final: Modify all to your private needs, like adjust your domain to match CNAME (see the GitHub Actions Workflow yml)

 Go Live: Adjust the domain service provider where you bought your own domain to direct to your GitHub repo

### Techs: Keep it simple first, Vitepress on GitHub seems a good start
 - Runs on nearly every env: server + client. Here GitHub Pages and all browsers / hardware
 - Add just new blogs as a markdown file - atm, new blog posts must be written locally in your IDE and published from there
 - For IDE I use Eclipse, but any other tool like VSCode, IntelliJ, Atom,... will do - or just edit files on GitHub - but that could be some hassle

 For later I hope it is easy as well to build on other features, like blog publish & comments from others as well > [StaticMan](https://staticman.net)?

 - Static Pages: Fast loading
 - Pre-Rendered
 - No huge size of libraries
 - First incentive: It is owned by you, and you are responsible but also fully beneficiary
 - More incentify & add share buttons / links / commenting / paywalls / ads ... must be simple
 - Add TimeStamping with publishing

 Later add dynamic fun, stats, SEO, ... lets see or discuss more eg via mail / Linkedin chat function
